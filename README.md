# auto-crud-rbac-platform
This project is a low-code platform that lets you create data models from a web interface and automatically generates CRUD APIs, an admin dashboard, and role-based access control. Once a model is published, it’s saved as a JSON file and the system instantly sets up all endpoints and permissions.
